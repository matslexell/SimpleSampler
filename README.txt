The simple sampler application is started from the main.pd file. 

To use the simple sampler follow these steps:

1. Press the red "Ta bort" button once (just in case)
2. Toggle the choice of algorithm (SOLA, FFT & Pitch)
3. Press the white button that says "Tryck här först för att spela_in" while singing a note
4. Press the dark green button that says "Skapa_o_pitch"
5. If you have a midikeyboard connected and setup correctly you can now play your own voice sample!

PS Try the simpler version, on folder inside, it will hopefully work if this one doesn't!
